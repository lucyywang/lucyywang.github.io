        Hello!<br><br>
        I'm Lucy Wang, a UI/UX designer and software engineer dedicated to sustainability. In the past, I have worked in <a href="https://www.plenty.ag/">indoor farming</a> and <a href="https://mosaic.us/">construction software</a>. Computationally, my interests are <a href="/">data visualization</a> and scalable application architecture.
        <br><br>
        While I studied computer science because of the way it taught me to think, I am drawn to architecture (the built kind) for the way it teaches one to see and feel. Recently, I completed a post-baccalaureate program in architecture at the University of California, Berkeley. Driven by a need for a sustainable future, I hope to transition into the architecture discipline.
